# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Firebase setup (local)

This project can use Firebase Authentication. To enable it locally:

1. Install the Firebase SDK:

```powershell
npm install firebase --save
```

2. Open `app/firebaseConfig.ts` and replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project's configuration (apiKey, authDomain, etc.).

3. Run the app:

```powershell
npm start
```

Note: after installing `firebase`, the TypeScript server/editor might need a restart to pick up new types.

## Removing the old tabs group

If you want to permanently remove the legacy `app/(tabs)` folder (I prepared the drawer rework), run this in PowerShell from the project root:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\app\"(tabs)"
```

This will delete the folder and its files. Make a backup first if unsure.
